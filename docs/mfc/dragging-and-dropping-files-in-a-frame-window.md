# Dragging and Dropping Files in a Frame Window
The frame window manages a relationship with File Explorer or File Manager.  
  
 By adding a few initializing calls in your override of the `CWinApp` member function `InitInstance`, as described in [CWinApp: The Application Class](../mfc/cwinapp--the-application-class.md), you can have your frame window indirectly open files dragged from File Explorer or File Manager and dropped in the frame window. See [File Manager Drag and Drop](../mfc/special-cwinapp-services.md).
